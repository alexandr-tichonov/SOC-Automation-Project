# SOC-Automation-Project

## Introduction
The intended purpose of this project was to gain practical hands-on experience in security **automation**, **detection**, and **response**, and attain valuable insight into the inner workings of a real-life security operations center (SOC) workflow. The modern SOC environment ingests a massive amount of alerts, commonly from numerous endpoints, which forces analysts to often respond to events that could have easily been automated, thus contributing to event fatigue and weakening security posture. To help alleviate some of the burden, a vast assortment of effective, scalable, and cost-effective tools were assembled into a comprehensive workflow that collects telemetry, enriches it with threat intelligence, and automates response actions. 

Although this project was used as a learning experience and thus does not have the complexity nor nuance required to automate complex SOC systems, the underlying design used is highly scalabe and cost effective. Using an orchestration platform like Shuffle, additional integrations and automated tasks can easily be implemented facilitating rapid adaptability to new threats, and allowing any SOC systems to configure automation and response to their own liking. The result is a system that not only improves efficiency, but also supports proactive security monitoring, where analysts can focus on high-value decision making instead of repetitive manual tasks.  

## Objective
The final objective of this project was to employ a vast assortment of scalable and cost-effective tools, and assemble them into an **end-to-end security** workflow that can successfully ingest and centralize telemetry collected from Windows and Linux endpoints, enrich suspicious indicators of compromise with external threat intelligence sources, and provide automatic alerting and case management for further investigations.

Additionally, this workflow was designed to notify the analyst of malicious activity via email and prompt them to take responsive action, such as blocking IP addresses.
